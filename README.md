ðŸ“Œ Project Description
This project is a digital menu system developed using Minimal API in C# with .NET 7 for the backend and React with TypeScript for the frontend. The main goal is to provide a modern, responsive interface for restaurant management, allowing users to create, read, update, and delete restaurants, dishes, categories, and ingredients.

The Web API follows the RESTful standard, with data persistence handled via Entity Framework Core and a SQLite database. On the frontend, the system displays information in an interactive and organized way, making it easy to manage and browse the menu.
